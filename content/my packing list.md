Packing is the most challenging part of an overseas trip for me. Planning the itinerary comes a close second but the fear of forgetting an item is one of the demons I fight the night before my flight. 

To ease the pain of thinking of what to pack before every trip, I've decided to document my generic packing list for my future self to refer to.
